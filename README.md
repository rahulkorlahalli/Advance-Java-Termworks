# Advance Java Termworks 

### Problem Statement 1
1. Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of stream classes in Java. 
Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of stream classes in Java. Assume that 
an input file named "input.txt" already exists with few lines of random text. Accept a filename 
from the user, this will be the destination file.
Write a menu driven program to do the following:
1) Tranfer the contents of the input file to the destination file – one byte at a time using 
FileInputStream /FileOutputStream class
2) Tranfer the contents of the input file to the destination file using the ByteArrayInputStream
/ByteArrayInputStream class
3) Display the contents of the destination file.

### Problem Statement 2
2. Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of Java’s Type Wrappers. 
Write a menu-driven Java Program to create an ArrayList of (1) integers and (2) floats of user 
specified length. Write a set of overloaded methods to “add” and/or “remove” elements from the 
arrays and another set of overloaded methods to perform linear search on the arrays, given the key 
element. Create object(s) to demonstrate the above functionalities. 

### Problem Statement 3
3. Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of reading and writing binary 
operations in Java.
Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of reading and writing binary data in 
Java.
1) Read the source and destination file names. 
2) Read user defined text to be written to the source file.
3) Write every alternate byte from the source to the destination file.
4) Compare the properties of the file.

### Problem Statement 4
4. Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of File I/O operations in Java.<br>
4.1 ) Write a Java program to create a file and perform various operations that are available. 
Write user-specified content to the file and re-do the operations.<br> 
4.2 ) Write a menu driven Java program to read contents of a file and :
a) print characters on the console – one character at a time
b) print the entire file
c) print contents to another file.<br>
Java (read both source & target file names & check for their existence/ non – existence to take 
appropriate actions).<br>
4.3 ) Write a Java program to copy Content of One File (existing file) to another (create new) 
File (character-by-character / line-by-line) and compare the properties of both files.<br>
4.4 ) Write a Java program to get the attributes of a specified file.

### Problem Statement 5
5. Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of Multithreading.<br>
5.1) Write a multithreaded Java program to create a list of numbers and then sort the contents 
in ascending (thread 1) and descending (thread 2).<br>
5.2) Write a multithreaded Java program print Fibonacci & Reverse series with thread 
 Class/Runnable interface.

### Problem Statement 6
6. Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of Synchronization in Java.<br> 
6.1) Write a Java program to demonstrate how the standard operations on a "Stack" can be 
synchronized.<br>
⚠️**TO BE ADDED** 6.2) Write a Java program to demonstrate how the standard operations on a bank account can 
be synchronized.

### Problem Statement 7
7. Write a Java Program to demonstrate the implementation of JDBC packages in Java. <br>
7.1) Program to insert, update, delete & select records from a given table (can be any simple
table).<br>
7.2) Program to execute SQL query on a single table.<br>
⚠️**TO BE ADDED** 7.3) Program to execute SQL query using joins on tables.<br>
7.4) Program to demonstrate transaction processing
